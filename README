NAME

    Plack::Middleware::TrafficLog - Log headers and body of HTTP traffic

SYNOPSIS

        # In app.psgi
        use Plack::Builder;
    
        builder {
            enable "TrafficLog", with_body => 1;
        };

DESCRIPTION

    This middleware logs the request and response messages with detailed
    information about headers and the body.

    The example log:

        [08/Aug/2012:16:59:47 +0200] [164836368] [127.0.0.1 -> 0:5000] [Request ]
        |GET / HTTP/1.1|Connection: TE, close|Host: localhost:5000|TE: deflate,gzi
        p;q=0.3|User-Agent: lwp-request/6.03 libwww-perl/6.03||
        [08/Aug/2012:16:59:47 +0200] [164836368] [127.0.0.1 <- 0:5000] [Response]
        |HTTP/1.0 200 OK|Content-Type: text/plain||Hello World

    This module works also with applications that have delayed response. In
    that case, each chunk is logged separately and shares the same unique
    ID number and headers.

    The body of the request and response is not logged by default. For
    streaming responses, only the first chunk is logged by default.

BUGS

    This module has an unstable API and it can be changed in the future.

    The log file can contain binary data if the PSGI server provides binary
    files.
