NAME
    Plack::Middleware::TrafficLog - Log headers and body of HTTP traffic

SYNOPSIS
      # In app.psgi
      use Plack::Builder;

      builder {
          enable "TrafficLog";
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware logs the request and response messages with detailed
    information.

    This module works also with applications which have delayed response. In
    that case each chunk is logged separately and shares the same ID number
    and headers.

SEE ALSO
    Plack, Plack::Middleware::AccessLog.

BUGS
    This module has unstable API and it can be changed in future.

    The log file can contain the binary data if the PSGI server provides
    binary files.
